/**
 * Create a command line program that can search on the occurrence of a word in a text file. You can use Jabberwocky.txt
 * as an example.
 * 
 * Answer the following questions:
    1. Which considerations did you make before creating the program? 
    2. What do you like / dislike in the result?
 * 
 * Requirements: a user should provide two required arguments on the command line specifying:
 *  1) The keyword to search on
 *  2) The file name to search in
 *  
 * Words are separated from each other by whitespace(s) (or the beginning or the end of the file)
 *  
 * Optionally the following arguments can be provided on the command line
 *  'part' : indicates that the keyword can match on parts of the words in the text file. If this argument is not present,
 *  the word should match a whole word in the text file. 
 *  'ci'    : indicates that the search should be case insensitive. If this argument is not present, the search
 *  will be performed on a case sensitive manner.
 *  
 * As an example, lets assume the text file 'Jabberwocky.txt' has the following content:
 * 
    "Beware the Jabberwock, my son 
       The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
       The frumious Bandersnatch!"
    
    He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
       Long time the manxome foe he sought-
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree, 
       And stood awhile in thought.
 * 
 * Now the user can run the program 'WordSearcher' with the command: 'java -jar WordSearcher.jar he Text.txt'
 * Which will search in the text file 'Text.txt' for the exact occurrence of the word 'he'. 
 * 
 * The result of the program is the following text on the command line:
 * 
    Found 2 occurrences of the keyword 'he' in 'Jabberwocky.txt'
    6   Long time the manxome foe he sought-
        --------------------------^^
    7   So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
        ----------^^
 * 
 * Thus the program shows the line number the keyword is found on and points to the exact place in the text it found the keyword.
 * Please note that only the lines where the keyword is found are shown on the screen.
 * 
 * Now the user wants to search on parts of the words, thus he executes the command 'java -jar WordSearcher.jar he Text.txt part'
 * This should result in the following:
 *  
    0  "Beware the Jabberwock, my son
        --------^^^
    1   The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
        ^^^-----------------^^^
    2   Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
        -------^^^
    3   The frumious Bandersnatch!"
        ^^^
    6   Long time the manxome foe he sought-
        ----------^^^-------------^^
    7   So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
        ----------^^----^^^
 * 
 * The user can also search case insensitive way using the command 'java -jar WordSearcher.jar he Text.txt part ci' which in addition 
 * to the results above, will find the occurrence of the word 'He' on line 5:
 * 
     5  He took his vorpal sword in hand;
        ^^
